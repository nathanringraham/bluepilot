# BluePilot: known-noisy log lines that log at ERROR severity for routine/expected conditions, not
# bugs — e.g. isotp_parallel_query logs a bad ECU response at .error() on every fingerprint scan where
# an ECU doesn't answer a diagnostic query cleanly (normal on real vehicles), and NNLC logs "no model
# for this car" at .error() for the majority of supported vehicles that simply lack a custom model.
# Filtered here (client-side, so they never leave the device) instead of at each call site, so this
# stays one central, reviewable/extendable list rather than scattered severity fixes.
# A filtered log line is still recorded as a breadcrumb (LoggingIntegration adds those independently
# of before_send), so it still shows up as trailing context on a real crash from the same process —
# only suppressed from becoming its own standalone issue.

  # NOTE: cloudlog.event(...) wraps the payload in NiceOrderedDict (common/logging_extra.py), whose
